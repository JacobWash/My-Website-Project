            <h2> Early Life</h2>
                <p> I lived my entire childhood in Ringsted with my parents and later also with our dog. Very close to our home was my grandparents' house, where I spent a lot of time. </p>
                <p> I went to school in the same time and I could bike to school in no time. There is where my interests in bikes and cycling started. </p>
                <p> I graduated from my secondary education in 2015 - and I had decided well in advanced that I wanted to go "the business way" - starting with attending a business high school. The school was very close to my secondary school so I could keep my old friends, and still bike to school, as well a getting the chance to get to know new people. </p>

            <h2> High-school and gap year</h2>
                <p> I spent three years in high school, from 2015 to 2018. I really enjoyed it! The courses were good, I performed well and I had gotten many good and close friends, which made even the hard and difficult times enjoyable. </p>
                <p> At the same time, I started at a new job - at the magical Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. It is the world's second oldest amusement park and it is a fantastic place right in the middle of Copenhagen. Even though I had to commute for about an hour to get to and from work, I loved every single shift I had at work. I taught me some many skills and a whole mindset of how to be service minded. Also, I got so many new friends and it was always enjoyable being at work or at parties! </p>
                <p> However, all good times have an end. Mine came when I graduated from high school. It was a very nice experience and there was parties the whole summer! But, something new was awaiting me. I had accepted an internship in Luxembourg during my gap year between high school and university. It was the first time I had to leave my friends, family and girlfriend to be on my own! </p>
                <p> I spent one year in Luxembourg. And I absolutely loved it! It taught me some many things! How to live by myself (even as I shared an apartment with many others), how to wake up every morning, go to work and how to explore the world!
                <p> I eventually returned from Luxembourg, moved together with my girlfriend to Copenhagen, and started university in the summer of 2019. </p>

            <h2> University and future</h2>
                <p> I started studying at Copenhagen Business School, CBS, in August 2019. I enrolled in the bachelor of science in International Business. I was something different than high school, but I really liked it. Great friends, cool courses and professors, and many new opportunities.</p>
                <p> When moving back to Denmark, I transfered from my job in Luxembourg to the same company in Denmark, working from their Copenhagen office. And this time not as an intern but instead as a student assistant part-time while also managing my studies. I was difficult at times to balance very high workloads at school and at work, while also spending time with family and friends, but I managed and I enjoyed being busy - as long as I kept a structured daily schedule!</p>
                <p> During my gap year in Luxembourg, I also started running. Being in an office all day meant that I needed to do some exercise once in a while - and I decided to go for some weekly runs. Earlier in my life, I had tried to run, but I thought it was boring and I rather wanted to do cycling instead. But, I really got into running. It started slow and with short runs, but ended up in two half-marathons while in Luxembourg as well as a participation in the Copenhagen Half Marathon 2019!</p>
                <p> In March 2020, I decided that I wanted to try something new for work. I found a job post for KPMG's finance department. I looked cool, I applied, I went for an interview and I got the job! I was thrilled to start at a new place, but just at the moment, COVID-19 shut down the entire society in Denmark, meaning I had to start my new job from home.</p>
                <p> Eventually, I managed to get through until the other side and I have really enjoyed working at KPMG! At the time of writing, I am currently on an exchange program in the US, at The George Washington Unversity in Washington, D.C. It is a great opportunity for me to once more explore the world and get exposed to a new way to attend university, get some new and existing courses (one where I have learned to make this website!) and meet so many great people from all over the world!</p>
                <p> I am looking forward to returning to Denmark for Christmas and to write my bachelor thesis during the spring semester of 2022. Then, I will enroll at a master's degree at Copenhagen Business School, where I will graduate in the summer of 2024 - ready to take on the world! Hopefully, in the field of accounting or finance - but who knows where I will end up? I am ready to strike on every opportunity that I get during my future - and one thing is for sure: I am looking forward to everything!</p>
