# My-Website-Project
Website Project, Fall 2021, BADM 2301

<!--> This is a website project as part of my enrollment in the course, Management Informaiton Systems Technology, BADM 2301, at The George Washington University.
I have tried to the best of my ability to build this website from scratch and with my relatively small knowledge about html. 

But I am confident that the website works as intended.
Therefore, I do not recommend people to copy this website - but I will not object if somebody wants to use part of code to incorporate into their own projects, if they find that I have done something smart that matches their requirements!

Thank you!
